# epi_longitudinal

Applied longitudinal epidemiology project with model comparison.

## Models
- Linear Mixed-Effects Models (full vs reduced)
- GEE with different working correlation structures

## Model Selection
- AIC / BIC (Mixed Models)
- Likelihood Ratio Test (nested models)
- QIC (GEE)
- Prediction error (RMSE)

## Goal
Demonstrate model selection procedure for longitudinal epidemiologic data.

## Project Structure

- `src/`: Python scripts for model fitting and visualization  
- `sql/`: SQL scripts for longitudinal data preparation
